AI Experiments

Introduction
-
This repository is a messy collection of some experiments related to artificial intelligence. It will contain both library code as well as examples and maybe even full applications.
As the codebase grows and certain parts mature, it will become inevitable that these are moved to somewhere else or to restructure this project.

To Do
-
* Create a structure to represent a Bayes Network.
* Add some code to perform probabiliy calculations (if needed by any actual AI).
* Implement a K Nearest Neighbours algorithm.
* Implement a K Means algorithm.
* Implement Markov Models.
